// Finally, we're asking each person to tell us their name.


// First, Walid the Engineer comes to the party. When he arrives, he goes to the table with name tags for Developers, because there aren't any for Engineers. He picks up a blank name tag, writes "Walid" on it, and puts it on.
// Later, Abdullah the Developer comes to the party. He also goes to the table with name tags for Developers. He finds that there's only one name tag left, and it already has "Walid" written on it. But, because of the party's rules, he has to wear a name tag. So, he puts on the "Walid" name tag, even though his name is Abdullah.
// Then, Alex the Person comes to the party. He goes to a separate table with name tags for Persons. He picks up a blank name tag, writes "Alex" on it, and puts it on.
// Now, when you ask each of them their name (according to their name tag), Walid and Abdullah will both say "Walid" because they are wearing the same name tag. Alex will say "Alex", because he got his name tag from a different table.
// The name tags represent the "instance" in our PHP code. The rules of the party represent the Singleton pattern, which says there can only be one name tag (or instance) per table (or class).
